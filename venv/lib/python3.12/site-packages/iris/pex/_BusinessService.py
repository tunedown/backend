    """ This class is responsible for receiving the data from external system and sending it to business processes or business operations in the production.
    The business service can use an adapter to access the external system, which is specified in the InboundAdapter property. 
    There are three ways of implementing a business service:
    1) Polling business service with an adapter - The production framework at regular intervals calls the adapterâ€™s OnTask() method, 
        which sends the incoming data to the the business service ProcessInput() method, which, in turn calls the OnProcessInput method with your code.
    2) Polling business service that uses the default adapter - In this case, the framework calls the default adapter's OnTask method with no data. 
        The OnProcessInput() method then performs the role of the adapter and is responsible for accessing the external system and receiving the data.
    3) Nonpolling business service - The production framework does not initiate the business service. Instead custom code in either a long-running process 
        or one that is started at regular intervals initiates the business service by calling the Director.CreateBusinessService() method.
